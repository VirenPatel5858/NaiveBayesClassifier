We have used Jupyter notebook to run our python code and we have added a NaiveBayes.ipynb, which is the jupyter notebook.To get the output add the path of the files TestData.csv and TrainData.csv in the jupyter notebook.
Try running the jupyter notebook file so that you could see the plots that we have created for the given data.


We have also attached NaiveBayes.py file that contains the python code we developed.
